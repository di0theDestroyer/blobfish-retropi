# Welcome to the Blobfish RetroPI-Day Submittal

RetroPI-day is a fun day.

## History

OSIsoft has PI. And, every PI has its day.

## Ohyea, clone dat repo

Just go ahead and clone the repo from whatever the hell link it shows 
above.

## Install some dependencies, ftw

### First, python, because gross.

Install python2.7 or later -- or install latest python3 and be sure to 
use ‘py -2’ below...

### Then, be all about that 'py -2 -m' command (especially if you're running python3)

So, go on and 'pip' that sh** hard:

--> for UI framework: 
'py -2 -m pip install windows_curses'

--> for wikipedia api: 
'py -2 -m pip install wikipedia'

--> for image-to-ascii conversion: 
'py -2 -m pip install pillow '

### And, when you're feelin' brave.

cd /wherever-we-should-be/  \
py -2 blobfish_terminal_ui.py
